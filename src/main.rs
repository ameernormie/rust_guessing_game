        /* we want to convert the String the program reads as input into a real number

        Rust allows us to shadow the previous value of gue  ss with a new one.
        This feature is often used in situations in which you want to convert a value from one type to another type.
        The parse method on strings parses a string into some kind of number.
        The parse method returns a Result type. If parse returns an Err Result variant because it couldnâ€™t
        create a number from the string, the expect call will crash the game and print the message we give it.
